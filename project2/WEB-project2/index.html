        <p class="post-content">A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Is A Form Of Universally Accessible Digital Money In A Nation And Holds The Same Value As The Country's Paper Currency. Like A Cryptocurrency, A CBCD Is Held In The Form Of Tokens. CBDCs Are Different From Regular Digital Cash Forms Like In Online Bank Accounts Because CBDCs Are Established Through The Central Bank Within A Country, With Liabilities Held By One's Government, Rather Than From A Commercial Bank.[36] Approximately Nine Countries Have Already[When?] Established A CBDC, With Interest In The System Increasing Highly Throughout The World. In These Nations, CBDCs Have Been Used As A Form Of Exchange And A Way For Governments To Try To Prevent Risks From Occurring Within Their Financial Systems.[37] A Major Problem With Central Bank Digital Currencies Is Deciding Whether The Currency Should Be Easily Trackable. If It's Traceable, The Government Has More Control Than It Currently Does. Additionally, There's A Technical Aspect To Consider: Whether CBDCs Should Be Based On Tokens Or Accounts And How Much Anonymity Users Should Have.
